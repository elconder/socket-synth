      <h1>Socket Synthesizer</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>Instructions:</strong> There are sixteen columns in the grid below. Each column represents a
        quarter note. Each row represents a note. When you click on a square in the grid, the note will play
        when the sequencer reaches that beat.
      </p>

      <p>
        But, here's the fun part: you're not playing alone. When other users connect, you'll see their sequences
        down below. Your sequencer will play all of the notes sequenced by all of the users connected. If no one
        else is connected, you can always open a second window and play around (although you'll probably want to
        mute your other window).
      </p>
